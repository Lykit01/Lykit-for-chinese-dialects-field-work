# Lykit-for-chinese-dialects-field-work
This is a excel plug for chinese dialects field work.
You can guess why I started coding.I made up the name 'Lykit' for the tool,which means 'lingyin kit'('lingyin means listen to the the sound.).But I have to quit this job because some incidents happened so that I won't work in the field for a long time.But I hope my tool can really help the chinese dialect field work.
The plug is written in vba.The vb file is the source code,the xlam file is the plug and can be added to your excel.The usage will be written as long as I am not occupied.
